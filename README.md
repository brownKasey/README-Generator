## Description

Working on readme is one of my least favorite parts of uploading a project to a repo on Github, so to fix this problem I've decided to create this README generator. It helps by giving you basic prompts to answer and once all prompts are answered a README.md file will be generated.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

Open terminal, find the file where the index.js file is located and run 'node index.js' in the terminal and click enter to start the application.

## Usage
Open terminal in VS code or your computer's terminal and find where the index.js file. Once you are where the file is located in terminal run 'node index.js' the click enter. 

Answer the prompts that ask you about your project. Then, once you're done a readme.md file will be created based on how you answered the prompts.
